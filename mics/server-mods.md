Objects from all Curated Projects! 6250 Objects! 15/3/2023 UPDATE (CREATED BY Loco)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

Ever wanted one _specific_ object from some curated project? Well now you can have almost every single object from curated projects, it is only 150mb, that's not too much compared to the +2,5gb for all curated projects combined.\
\
Some objects might be missing, I deleted almost every single object and note which used masterbundle override as it would be complicated for me to fix those, it shouldn't be a big issue and doesn't have a big impact. There are currently 6250 objects, which is more than enough for map making!\
\
_All credits go to original makers of all curated projects._\
