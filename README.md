We are trying to bring the best possible [<mark style="color:green;">Unturned</mark>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/Unturned/) **Role-Playish** experience. Would you like to **Role-Play**? There are endless possibilities how you can **Role-Play**. Set up your own business, join factions, make money through the variety of jobs, rob people and much more! Are you more of a PvP person? You can kill people at the [Berry Island](mics/location.md) or in the [Radioactive Deadzone](mics/location.md)! This will definitely fulfil your adrenaline needs! Do you like to explore? You can explore the big map, ocean, a lot of caves and many other eastereggs.
